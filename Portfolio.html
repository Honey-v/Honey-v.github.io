Born and raised in the 6ix, I was the bubbly and optimistic little girl who would spontaneously break out into a song or a dance. 
<p><p><br>Up until NPower, I have attended 10 different schools from elementary to college – honing my social skills and learning how to stand out, or my mom calls it, “twinkle” in a crowd. 
One of my role models growing up was Trinie Kwan, the yellow power rangers from Mighty Morphins Power Ranger {Major throwback!}. Ever since then I have been on a life-long pursuit to become a, “Hot Asian Girl”. Becoming a Hot Asian Girl, entitles being well-educated and trained in a variety of topics, a healthy and strong body, and a good sense of humour {I’m working on it!}
